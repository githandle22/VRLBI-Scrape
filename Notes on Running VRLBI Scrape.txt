In Command Prompt
cd OneDrive\Documents\Node Stuff\VRLBI Scrape
node vrlbi_index.js 12 (searches for valid properties on vrlbi.com) !!! update the sample number in "option 12" to be the next sample to be run
node vrlbi_index.js 15 (runs a scrape, automatically adjusts the sample number based on properties in propCollection)

At the start of a new year need to:
1) update the calendar sample dates and week of interest dates in the file VRLBI_index.js (option 21)
	by hand typing in the new dates and running: node vrlbi_index.js 21
	be sure to change "year", "date", and "saturdayDate" (date and year!)
2) in VRLBI_SCRAPER.js near line 477, need to change the year in the following command: end = string.indexOf("2025");

3) in VRLBI_Db_if.js near line 233 in this.writePropBookedData, there may be a magic number:sampleNum: {"$gt":8}
	the 8 needs to be changed to the last sample number in the previous season

find out why badPropCount is not being written in scanStatus collection
things to add
find locLat
find locLong
find services (linen, cleaning)
find add ons
maybe evaluate /week, /night rates

completed
1) add a function to test only inactive properties to see if they are still invalid - I think this can be done by adjusting the limits in vrlbi_index.js selection "12" and running selection "12" with the adjusted limits
2) save all rates from the rate table - booked or not
	this could be a new collection "rates" with _id as the index
	for each of the 2000 properties, store the 16 weekly rates
	also save sample number, but not uniquely so older data are overwritten
